adding relative paths(this will be similar to the work done on depth search)
[] pass a variable from the main script that is a reference to pwd
  - this will store a path trace from home to engen
  - this can then be used for all imports, with relative paths


[] use reference to pwd for relative imports and for pointint to where main, and engen are in the
file system.
  - 2 first entry points are main(when env generation is being done for the first time) and engen(after main has been run)
  - in both entry points, import function from helpers file that will allow engen to be found in file system
  - this function will run pwd and can potentially take an argument that decides where the slicing of the pwd path output ends
  - pass this reference down through the scripts that are invoked after similar to component props that are being passed down alreday
